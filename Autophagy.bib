  abstract               = {Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and its incidence is continually increasing. Although anticancer therapy has improved significantly, it still has limited efficacy for tumor eradication and is highly toxic to healthy cells. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies to improve chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapy are an important goal in cancer research. Macroautophagy (herein referred to as autophagy) is a conserved lysosomal degradation pathway for the intracellular recycling of macromolecules and clearance of damaged organelles and misfolded proteins to ensure cellular homeostasis. Dysfunctional autophagy contributes to many diseases, including cancer. Autophagy can suppress or promote tumors depending on the developmental stage and tumor type, and modulating autophagy for cancer treatment is an interesting therapeutic approach currently under intense investigation. Nutritional restriction is a promising protocol to modulate autophagy and enhance the efficacy of anticancer therapies while protecting normal cells. Here, the description and role of autophagy in tumorigenesis will be summarized. Moreover, the possibility of using fasting as an adjuvant therapy for cancer treatment, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying this approach, will be presented.},

  abstract        = {Autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic degradation system, has been implicated as a convergent mechanism in various longevity pathways. Autophagic activity decreases with age in several organisms, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that the expression of Rubicon, a negative regulator of autophagy, increases in aged worm, fly and mouse tissues at transcript and/or protein levels, suggesting that an age-dependent increase in Rubicon impairs autophagy over time, and thereby curtails animal healthspan. Consistent with this idea, knockdown of Rubicon extends worm and fly lifespan and ameliorates several age-associated phenotypes. Tissue-specific experiments reveal that Rubicon knockdown in neurons has the greatest effect on lifespan. Rubicon knockout mice exhibits reductions in interstitial fibrosis in kidney and reduced α-synuclein accumulation in the brain. Rubicon is suppressed in several long-lived worms and calorie restricted mice. Taken together, our results suggest that suppression of autophagic activity by Rubicon is one of signatures of aging.},

  abstract               = {The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) coordinates cellular growth and metabolism with environmental inputs to ensure that cells grow only under favourable conditions. When active, mTORC1 stimulates biosynthetic pathways including protein, lipid and nucleotide synthesis and inhibits cellular catabolism through repression of the autophagic pathway, thereby promoting cell growth and proliferation. The recruitment of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface has been shown to be essential for its activation. This finding has significantly enhanced our knowledge of mTORC1 regulation and has focused the attention of the field on the lysosome as a signalling hub which coordinates several homeostatic pathways. The intriguing localisation of mTORC1 to the cellular organelle that plays a crucial role in catabolism enables mTORC1 to feedback to autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis, thus leading mTORC1 to enact precise spatial and temporal control of cell growth. This review will cover the signalling interactions which take place on the surface of lysosomes and the cross-talk which exists between mTORC1 activity and lysosomal function.},

  abstract           = {The mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) is a master regulator of several crucial cellular processes, including protein synthesis, cellular growth, proliferation, autophagy, lysosomal function, and cell metabolism. mTOR interacts with specific adaptor proteins to form 2 multiprotein complexes, called mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2). In the cardiovascular system, the mTOR pathway regulates both physiological and pathological processes in the heart. It is needed for embryonic cardiovascular development and for maintaining cardiac homeostasis in postnatal life. Studies involving mTOR loss-of-function models revealed that mTORC1 activation is indispensable for the development of adaptive cardiac hypertrophy in response to mechanical overload. mTORC2 is also required for normal cardiac physiology and ensures cardiomyocyte survival in response to pressure overload. However, partial genetic or pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 reduces cardiac remodeling and heart failure in response to pressure overload and chronic myocardial infarction. In addition, mTORC1 blockade reduces cardiac derangements induced by genetic and metabolic disorders and has been reported to extend life span in mice. These studies suggest that pharmacological targeting of mTOR may represent a therapeutic strategy to confer cardioprotection, although clinical evidence in support of this notion is still scarce. This review summarizes and discusses the new evidence on the pathophysiological role of mTOR signaling in the cardiovascular system.},

  abstract               = {Cells and organisms must coordinate their metabolic activity with changes in their environment to ensure their growth only when conditions are favourable. In order to maintain cellular homoeostasis, a tight regulation between the synthesis and degradation of cellular components is essential. At the epicentre of the cellular nutrient sensing is the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) which connects environmental cues, including nutrient and growth factor availability as well as stress, to metabolic processes in order to preserve cellular homoeostasis. Under nutrient-rich conditions mTORC1 promotes cell growth by stimulating biosynthetic pathways, including synthesis of proteins, lipids and nucleotides, and by inhibiting cellular catabolism through repression of the autophagic pathway. Its close signalling interplay with the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) dictates whether the cell actively favours anabolic or catabolic processes. Underlining the role of mTORC1 in the coordination of cellular metabolism, its deregulation is linked to numerous human diseases ranging from metabolic disorders to many cancers. Although mTORC1 can be modulated by a number of different inputs, amino acids represent primordial cues that cannot be compensated for by any other stimuli. The understanding of how amino acids signal to mTORC1 has increased considerably in the last years; however this area of research remains a hot topic in biomedical sciences. The current ideas and models proposed to explain the interrelationship between amino acid sensing, mTORC1 signalling and autophagy is the subject of the present review.},

  abstract           = {BACKGROUND: The mammalian circadian clock and its associated clock genes are increasingly been recognized as critical components for a number of physiological and disease processes that extend beyond hormone release, thermal regulation, and sleep-wake cycles. New evidence suggests that clinical behavior disruptions that involve prolonged shift work and even space travel may negatively impact circadian rhythm and lead to multi-system disease. METHODS: In light of the significant role circadian rhythm can hold over the body's normal physiology as well as disease processes, we examined and discussed the impact circadian rhythm and clock genes hold over lifespan, neurodegenerative disorders, and tumorigenesis. RESULTS: In experimental models, lifespan is significantly reduced with the introduction of arrhythmic mutants and leads to an increase in oxidative stress exposure. Interestingly, patients with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease may suffer disease onset or progression as a result of alterations in the DNA methylation of clock genes as well as prolonged pharmacological treatment for these disorders that may lead to impairment of circadian rhythm function. Tumorigenesis also can occur with the loss of a maintained circadian rhythm and lead to an increased risk for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, breast cancer, and metastatic colorectal cancer. Interestingly, the circadian clock system relies upon the regulation of the critical pathways of autophagy, the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), and silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (SIRT1) as well as proliferative mechanisms that involve the wingless pathway of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway to foster cell survival during injury and block tumor cell growth. CONCLUSION: Future targeting of the pathways of autophagy, mTOR, SIRT1, and Wnt that control mammalian circadian rhythm may hold the key for the development of novel and effective therapies against aging- related disorders, neurodegenerative disease, and tumorigenesis.},

  abstract               = {Autophagy is an intracellular protein-degradation process that is conserved across eukaryotes including yeast and humans. Under nutrient starvation conditions, intracellular proteins are transported to lysosomes and vacuoles via membranous structures known as autophagosomes, and are degraded. The various steps of autophagy are regulated by the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1/mTORC1). In this review, a history of this regulation and recent advances in such regulation both in yeast and mammals will be discussed. Recently, the mechanism of autophagy initiation in yeast has been deduced. The autophagy-related gene 13 (Atg13) and the unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (Ulk1) are the most crucial substrates of TORC1 in autophagy, and by its dephosphorylation, autophagosome formation is initiated. Phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Atg13 is regulated spatially inside the cell. Another TORC1-dependent regulation lies in the expression of autophagy genes and vacuolar/lysosomal hydrolases. Several transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations are controlled by TORC1, which affects autophagy activity in yeast and mammals.},

  abstract               = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive disease associated with the production and deposition of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) aggregates and neurofibrillary tangles, which lead to synaptic and neuronal damage. Reduced autophagic flux has been widely associated with the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles (AV), which has been proposed to contribute to aggregate build-up observed in AD. As such, targeting autophagy regulation has received wide review, where an understanding as to how this mechanism can be controlled will be important to neuronal health. The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which was found to be hyperactive in AD brain, regulates autophagy and is considered to be mechanistically important to aberrant autophagy in AD. Hormones and nutrients such as insulin and leucine, respectively, positively regulate mTORC1 activation and are largely considered to inhibit autophagy. However, in AD brain there is a dysregulation of nutrient metabolism, linked to insulin resistance, where a role for insulin treatment to improve cognition has been proposed. Recent studies have highlighted that mitochondrial proteins such as glutamate dehydrogenase and the human branched chain aminotransferase protein, through metabolism of leucine and glutamate, differentially regulate mTORC1 and autophagy. As the levels of the hBCAT proteins are significantly increased in AD brain relative to aged-matched controls, we discuss how these metabolic pathways offer new potential therapeutic targets. In this review article, we highlight the core regulation of autophagy through mTORC1, focusing on how insulin and leucine will be important to consider in particular with respect to our understanding of nutrient load and AD pathogenesis.},

Following the initial discovery that localisation of the nutrient-sensitive kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), to the lysosome was essential for mTORC1 activation, the field has rapidly expanded to reveal the role of the lysosome as a platform permitting the co-ordination of several homeostatic signalling pathways. Much is now understood about how the lysosome contributes to amino acid sensing by mTORC1, the involvement of the energy-sensing kinase, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), at the lysosome and how both AMPK and mTORC1 signalling pathways feedback to lysosomal biogenesis and regeneration following autophagy. This review will cover the classical role of the lysosome in autophagy, the dynamic signalling interactions which take place on the lysosomal surface and the multiple levels of cross-talk which exist between lysosomes, AMPK and mTORC1.},

  abstract             = {Cellular homeostasis is controlled by an evolutionary conserved cellular digestive process called autophagy. This mechanism is tightly regulated by the two sensor elements called mTORC1 and AMPK. mTORC1 is one of the master regulators of proteostasis, while AMPK maintains cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK is able to promote autophagy by phosphorylating ULK1, the key inducer of autophagosome formation, while mTORC1 downregulates the self-eating process via ULK1 under nutrient rich conditions. We claim that the feedback loops of the AMPK-mTORC1-ULK1 regulatory triangle guarantee the appropriate response mechanism when nutrient and/or energy supply changes. In our opinion, there is an essential double negative feedback loop between mTORC1 and AMPK. Namely, not only does AMPK downregulate mTORC1, but mTORC1 also inhibits AMPK and this inhibition is required to keep AMPK inactive at physiological conditions. The aim of the present study was to explore the dynamical characteristic of AMPK regulation upon various cellular stress events. We approached our scientific analysis from a systems biology perspective by incorporating both theoretical and molecular biological techniques. In this study, we confirmed that AMPK is essential to promote autophagy, but is not sufficient to maintain it. AMPK activation is followed by ULK1 induction, where protein has a key role in keeping autophagy active. ULK1-controlled autophagy is always preceded by AMPK activation. With both ULK1 depletion and mTORC1 hyper-activation (i.e., TSC1/2 downregulation), we demonstrate that a double negative feedback loop between AMPK and mTORC1 is crucial for the proper dynamic features of the control network. Our computer simulations have further proved the dynamical characteristic of AMPK-mTORC1-ULK1 controlled cellular nutrient sensing.},

  abstract             = {Loss of innervation of skeletal muscle is a determinant event in several muscle diseases. Although several effectors have been identified, the pathways controlling the integrated muscle response to denervation remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that PKB/Akt and mTORC1 play important roles in regulating muscle homeostasis and maintaining neuromuscular endplates after nerve injury. To allow dynamic changes in autophagy, mTORC1 activation must be tightly balanced following denervation. Acutely activating or inhibiting mTORC1 impairs autophagy regulation and alters homeostasis in denervated muscle. Importantly, PKB/Akt inhibition, conferred by sustained mTORC1 activation, abrogates denervation-induced synaptic remodeling and causes neuromuscular endplate degeneration. We establish that PKB/Akt activation promotes the nuclear import of HDAC4 and is thereby required for epigenetic changes and synaptic gene up-regulation upon denervation. Hence, our study unveils yet-unknown functions of PKB/Akt-mTORC1 signaling in the muscle response to nerve injury, with important implications for neuromuscular integrity in various pathological conditions.},

A major route for activating autophagy involves inhibition of the mTORC1 kinase, but current mTORC1-targeting compounds do not allow complete and selective mTORC1 blockade. Here, we have coupled screening of a covalent ligand library with activity-based protein profiling to discover EN6, a small-molecule in vivo activator of autophagy that covalently targets cysteine 277 in the ATP6V1A subunit of the lysosomal v-ATPase, which activates mTORC1 via the Rag guanosine triphosphatases. EN6-mediated ATP6V1A modification decouples the v-ATPase from the Rags, leading to inhibition of mTORC1 signaling, increased lysosomal acidification and activation of autophagy. Consistently, EN6 clears TDP-43 aggregates, a causative agent in frontotemporal dementia, in a lysosome-dependent manner. Our results provide insight into how the v-ATPase regulates mTORC1, and reveal a unique approach for enhancing cellular clearance based on covalent inhibition of lysosomal mTORC1 signaling.},

High GPR137B expression can recruit and activate mTORC1 in the absence of amino acids. Furthermore, GPR137B also regulates the dissociation of activated Rag from lysosomes, suggesting that GPR137B controls a cycle of Rag activation and dissociation from lysosomes. GPR137B-knockout cells exhibited defective autophagy and an expanded lysosome compartment, similar to Rag-knockout cells. Like zebrafish RagA mutants, GPR137B-mutant zebrafish had upregulated TFEB target gene expression and an expanded lysosome compartment in microglia. Thus, GPR137B is a GPCR-like lysosomal regulatory protein that controls dynamic Rag and mTORC1 localization and activity as well as lysosome morphology.},

  abstract             = {Autophagy is an important cellular protein control process, which plays a key role in the regulation of cell homeostasis and pathogenesis of many human diseases including neurodegenerative diseases. Reduced autophagic activity and abnormal protein aggregation are common features of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington's disease. Therefore, pharmacological regulation of overall autophagy may be helpful for effective treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we find Dynasore, a potent inhibitor of dynamin, can repress the lysosomal localization of mTOR and block the activity of mTORC1, which in turn enhances the nuclear translocation of the master regulators of autophagy including TFE3 and TFEB. We find that autophagic flux is upregulated in Dynasore-treated cells. Moreover, treatment of Dynasore significantly promotes the clearance of protein aggregates formed by mutant huntingtin protein containing expanded polyglutamine (polyQ), but not damaged mitochondria. In contrast, treatment with Dynasore has no effect on the clearance of polyQ aggregates of mutant huntingtin in ATG5-depleted cells, in which autophagy is defective. Taken together, our results indicate that Dynasore affects autophagic degradation of neurodegenerative disease-associated proteins by regulating mTORC1-TFEB signaling.},

The state of senescence is controlled by extensive rewiring of signalling pathways, at the heart of which lies the mammalian Target of Rapamycin Complex I (mTORC1). Here we discuss recent publications aiming to establish the mechanisms by which mTORC1 drives the senescence program. In particular, we highlight our data indicating that mTORC1 can be used as a target for senescence cell elimination in vitro. Suppression of mTORC1 is known to extend lifespan of yeast, worms, flies and some mouse models and our proof-of-concept experiments suggest that it can also act by reducing senescent cell load in vivo.},

  abstract             = {Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a clinically common and severe complication of ischemia‑reperfusion (I/R), associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, and prolonged hospitalization. Rapamycin is a type of macrolide, primarily used for anti‑rejection therapy following organ transplantation and the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Rapamycin has been identified to exert a protective effect against AKI induced by renal I/R as an autophagy inducer. However, whether rapamycin preconditioning may relieve AKI following cerebral I/R (CIR) remains to be fully elucidated. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of CIR on the renal system of rats and the role of rapamycin in AKI following CIR. In the present study, a CIR model was established in Sprague‑Dawley rats via a 90‑min period of middle cerebral artery occlusion and 24 h reperfusion, and pretreatment with an intraperitoneal injection of rapamycin (dosage: 1 mg/kg; 0.5 h) prior to CIR. The levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and the expression of inflammation‑, apoptosis‑ and autophagy‑associated markers were subsequently measured. In addition to certain histopathological alterations to the kidney, it was identified that CIR significantly increased the levels of serum creatinine, BUN, tumor necrosis factor‑α and interleukin‑1$\beta$, and significantly induced apoptosis and autophagy. It was observed that rapamycin induced autophagy through the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1/autophagy‑related 13/unc‑51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 signaling pathway, and that rapamycin pre‑treatment significantly improved renal function and alleviated renal tissue inflammation and cell apoptosis in rats following CIR. In conclusion, the results suggested that rapamycin may alleviate AKI following CIR via the induction of autophagy.},

  abstract             = {The mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase complex 1 (MTORC1) is a central cellular kinase that integrates major signaling pathways, allowing for regulation of anabolic and catabolic processes including macroautophagy/autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. Essential to these processes is the regulatory activity of TFEB (transcription factor EB). In a regulatory feedback loop modulating transcriptional levels of RRAG/Rag GTPases, TFEB controls MTORC1 tethering to membranes and induction of anabolic processes upon nutrient replenishment. We now show that TFEB promotes expression of endocytic genes and increases rates of cellular endocytosis during homeostatic baseline and starvation conditions. TFEB-mediated endocytosis drives assembly of the MTORC1-containing nutrient sensing complex through the formation of endosomes that carry the associated proteins RRAGD, the amino acid transporter SLC38A9, and activate AKT/protein kinase B (AKT p-T308). TFEB-induced signaling endosomes en route to lysosomes are induced by amino acid starvation and are required to dissociate TSC2, re-tether and activate MTORC1 on endolysosomal membranes. This study characterizes TFEB-mediated endocytosis as a critical process leading to activation of MTORC1 and autophagic function, thus identifying the importance of the dynamic endolysosomal system in cellular clearance.

  abstract             = {TRIM37 gene mutations cause mulibrey (muscle-liver-brain-eye) nanism, a severe growth disorder with prenatal onset. Although TRIM37 depletion normally induces apoptosis, patients with TRIM37 mutations have a high risk of developing tumors, suggesting that there may be an alternative pro-survival mechanism for TRIM37-deficient tumor cells. We find that TRIM37 interacts with MTOR and RRAGB proteins, enhances the MTOR-RRAGB interaction and promotes lysosomal localization of MTOR, thereby activating amino acid-stimulated MTORC1 signaling. In response to loss of TRIM37 functions, phosphorylation of TFEB is significantly reduced, resulting in its translocation into the nucleus enabling its transcriptional activation of genes involved in lysosome biogenesis and macroautophagy/autophagy. The enhanced autophagy depends on the inhibition of MTORC1 signaling and may serve as an alternative mechanism to survive the loss of TRIM37 functions. Our study unveils a positive role of TRIM37 in regulating the MTORC1-TFEB axis and provides mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of mulibrey nanism, as well as potential therapeutic treatment.

In cancer, mTOR signaling is highly activated, and the regulation of this signaling, as an anti-cancer strategy, has been emphasized. However, PP242 (inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2) alone did not induce human renal carcinoma cell death. In this study, we found that PP242 alone did not alter cell viability, but combined curcumin and PP242 treatment induced cell death. Combined PP242 and curcumin treatment induced Bax activation and decreased expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2. Furthermore, co-treatment with PP242 and curcumin-induced the downregulation of the Rictor (an mTORC2 complex protein) and Akt protein levels, and ectopic overexpression of Rictor or Akt inhibited PP242 plus curcumin induced cell death. Downregulation of Rictor increased cytosolic Ca  release from endoplasmic reticulum, which led to lysosomal damage in PP242 plus curcumin-treated cells. Furthermore, damaged lysosomes induced autophagy. Autophagy inhibitors markedly inhibited cell death. Finally, combined curcumin and PP242 treatment reduced tumor growth and induced cell death in xenograft models. Altogether, our results reveal that combined PP242 and curcumin treatment could induce autophagy-mediated cell death by reducing the expression of Rictor and Akt in renal carcinoma cells.},

Cell viability was assessed with CCK8 and cell proliferation was measured by EdU incorporation assay. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were examined by flow cytometry. Transmission electron microscopy was used to visualized autophagosomes. Activation of AMPK and inhibition of mTORC1/C2 pathways was assessed by Western blot analysis. RPMI8226 cells and U266 cell lines with AMPK knockdown were generated by transfection with small interfering RNA targeting the AMPK-α1 and α2 subunits using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Metformin effectively inhibited the proliferation of MM cell lines, an effect that was associated with the induction of autophagy and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, but not apoptosis. Metformin activated AMPK and repressed both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling pathways in myeloma cells as well as downstream molecular signaling pathways, such as p-4EBP1 and p-AKT. AMPK activation resulted in direct phosphorylation and activation of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), leading to inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). In addition, metformin inhibited myeloma cell growth in an AMPK-dependent manner. The xenograft mouse model further confirmed that metformin inhibited tumor growth by upregulation of AMPK and downregulation of mTOR. Metformin inhibits the proliferation of myeloma cells by inducing autophagy and cell-cycle arrest. Our results suggest that the molecular mechanism involves dual repression of mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways via AMPK activation. Our study provides a theoretical basis for the development of novel strategies for the treatment of MM using metformin as an already approved and safe drug.},

  abstract             = {Ammonia is a potent neurotoxin that is detoxified mainly by the urea cycle in the liver. Hyperammonemia is a common complication of a wide variety of both inherited and acquired liver diseases. If not treated early and thoroughly, it results in encephalopathy and death. Here, we found that hepatic autophagy is critically involved in systemic ammonia homeostasis by providing key urea-cycle intermediates and ATP. Hepatic autophagy is triggered in vivo by hyperammonemia through an α-ketoglutarate-dependent inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, and deficiency of autophagy impairs ammonia detoxification. In contrast, autophagy enhancement by means of hepatic gene transfer of the master regulator of autophagy transcription factor EB or treatments with the autophagy enhancers rapamycin and Tat-Beclin-1 increased ureagenesis and protected against hyperammonemia in a variety of acute and chronic hyperammonemia animal models, including acute liver failure and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, the most frequent urea-cycle disorder. In conclusion, hepatic autophagy is an important mechanism for ammonia detoxification because of its support of urea synthesis, and its enhancement has potential for therapy of both primary and secondary causes of hyperammonemia.},

Acetyltransferase p300, which acetylates histone and non-histone proteins, has been intensively studied in its role in cell growth and metabolism. However, the mechanism underlying the activation of p300 in cells remains largely unknown. Here, we identify the homeostatic sensor mTORC1 as a direct activator of p300. Activated mTORC1 interacts with p300 and phosphorylates p300 at 4 serine residues in the C-terminal domain. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of p300 by mTORC1 prevents the catalytic HAT domain from binding to the RING domain, thereby eliminating intra-molecular inhibition. Functionally, mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of p300 suppresses cell-starvation-induced autophagy and activates cell lipogenesis. These results uncover p300 as a direct target of mTORC1 and suggest that the mTORC1-p300 pathway plays a pivotal role in cell metabolism by coordinately controlling cell anabolism and catabolism.},

We hypothesized that MTORC1 may specifically regulate autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria. To test this, we used cells lacking tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2  cells), which show constitutive MTORC1 activation. TSC2  cells show MTORC1-dependent impaired autophagic flux after chemical uncoupling of mitochondria, increased mitochondrial-protein aging, and accumulation of p62/SQSTM1-positive mitochondria. Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) was also deficient in cells lacking TSC2, associated with altered expression of PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) and PARK2 translocation to uncoupled mitochondria, all of which were recovered by MTORC1 inhibition or expression of constitutively active forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1). These data prove the necessity of intact MTORC1 signaling to regulate two synergistic processes required for clearance of damaged mitochondria: (i) general autophagy initiation and (ii) PINK1/PARK2-mediated selective targeting of uncoupled mitochondria to the autophagic machinery.},

In this study, we investigate the role of autophagy and glutamine on the regulation of mTORC1, a critical kinase that regulates cell growth and proliferation. We report that supplementation of glutamine alone is sufficient to restore mTORC1 activity during prolonged amino acid starvation. Inhibition of autophagy abolishes the restorative effect of glutamine, suggesting that reactivation of mTORC1 is autophagy-dependent. Inhibition of glutaminolysis or transamination impairs glutamine-mediated mTORC1 reactivation, suggesting glutamine reactivates mTORC1 specifically through its conversion to glutamate and restoration of non-essential amino acid pool. Despite a persistent drop in essential amino acid pool during amino acid starvation, crosstalk between glutamine and autophagy is sufficient to restore insulin sensitivity of mTORC1. Thus, glutamine metabolism and autophagy constitute a specific metabolic program which restores mTORC1 activity during amino acid starvation.mTORC1 is a critical kinase that regulates cell growth and proliferation. Here the authors show that glutamine metabolism is sufficient to restore mTORC1 activity during prolonged amino acid starvation in an autophagy-dependent manner.},

During the initiation of pterygium, resting epithelial cells are activated and exhibit aberrant apoptosis and cell proliferation. Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central regulator of cell growth, cell proliferation, protein synthesis, autophagy and transcription. However, the effect of mTORC1 activation in epithelial cells on pterygium development has not yet been reported. Additionally, the roles of mTORC1 in aberrant apoptosis and cell proliferation during the initiation of pterygium, and the underlying mechanisms, are not known. Herein, we evaluated mTOR signalling in pterygium growth and development. The results revealed that mTOR signalling, especially mTORC1 signaling, is highly activated, and aberrant apoptosis and cell proliferation were observed in pterygium. mTORC1 activation inhibits apoptosis in pterygium by regulating Beclin 1-dependent autophagy via targeting Bcl-2. mTORC1 also negatively regulates fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) through inhibition of p73, thereby stimulating cell proliferation in pterygium. These data demonstrate that mTORC1 signalling is highly activated in pterygium and provide new insights into the pathogenesis and progression of pterygium. Hence, mTORC1 may be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of pterygium.},

Here we show that $\beta$-cell-specific loss of mTORC1 causes diabetes and $\beta$-cell failure due to defects in proliferation, autophagy, apoptosis and insulin secretion by using mice with conditional ($\beta$raKO) and inducible (MIP-$\beta$raKO ) raptor deletion. Through genetic reconstitution of mTORC1 downstream targets, we identify mTORC1/S6K pathway as the mechanism by which mTORC1 regulates $\beta$-cell apoptosis, size and autophagy, whereas mTORC1/4E-BP2-eIF4E pathway regulates $\beta$-cell proliferation. Restoration of both pathways partially recovers $\beta$-cell mass and hyperglycaemia. This study also demonstrates a central role of mTORC1 in controlling insulin processing by regulating cap-dependent translation of carboxypeptidase E in a 4EBP2/eIF4E-dependent manner.

  abstract             = {TPT1/TCTP (tumor protein, translationally-controlled 1) is highly expressed in tumor cells, known to participate in various cellular activities including protein synthesis, growth and cell survival. In addition, TPT1 was identified as a direct target of the tumor suppressor TP53/p53 although little is known about the mechanism underlying the anti-survival function of TPT1. Here, we describe a role of TPT1 in the regulation of the MTORC1 pathway through modulating the molecular machinery of macroautophagy/autophagy. TPT1 inhibition induced cellular autophagy via the MTORC1 and AMPK pathways, which are inhibited and activated, respectively, during treatment with the MTOR inhibitor rapamycin. We also found that the depletion of TPT1 potentiated rapamycin-induced autophagy by synergizing with MTORC1 inhibition. We further demonstrated that TPT1 knockdown altered the BECN1 interactome, a representative MTOR-independent pathway, to stimulate autophagosome formation, via downregulating BCL2 expression through activating MAPK8/JNK1, and thereby enhancing BECN1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K)-UVRAG complex formation. Furthermore, reduced TPT1 promoted autophagic flux by modulating not only early steps of autophagy but also autophagosome maturation. Consistent with in vitro findings, in vivo organ analysis using Tpt1 heterozygote knockout mice showed that autophagy is enhanced because of haploinsufficient TPT1 expression. Overall, our study demonstrated the novel role of TPT1 as a negative regulator of autophagy that may have potential use in manipulating various diseases associated with autophagic dysfunction.},

Their gene products form a complex that has become the focus of many signal transduction researchers. The TSC1-TSC2 (hamartin-tuberin) complex, through its GAP (GTPase-activating protein) activity towards the small G-protein Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain), is a critical negative regulator of mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1). As mTORC1 activity controls anabolic processes to promote cell growth, it is exquisitely sensitive to alterations in cell growth conditions. Through numerous phosphorylation events, the TSC1-TSC2 complex has emerged as the sensor and integrator of these growth conditions, relaying signals from diverse cellular pathways to properly modulate mTORC1 activity. In the present review we focus on the molecular details of TSC1-TSC2 complex regulation and function as it relates to the control of Rheb and mTORC1.},

  abstract        = {The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is the key signaling hub that regulates cellular protein homeostasis, growth, and proliferation in health and disease. As a prerequisite for activation of mTORC1 by hormones and mitogens, there first has to be an available pool of intracellular amino acids. Arginine, an amino acid essential during mammalian embryogenesis and early development is one of the key activators of mTORC1. Herein, we demonstrate that arginine acts independently of its metabolism to allow maximal activation of mTORC1 by growth factors via a mechanism that does not involve regulation of mTORC1 localization to lysosomes. Instead, arginine specifically suppresses lysosomal localization of the TSC complex and interaction with its target small GTPase protein, Rheb. By interfering with TSC-Rheb complex, arginine relieves allosteric inhibition of Rheb by TSC. Arginine cooperates with growth factor signaling which further promotes dissociation of TSC2 from lysosomes and activation of mTORC1. Arginine is the main amino acid sensed by the mTORC1 pathway in several cell types including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Dependence on arginine is maintained once hESCs are differentiated to fibroblasts, neurons, and hepatocytes, highlighting the fundamental importance of arginine-sensing to mTORC1 signaling. Together, our data provide evidence that different growth promoting cues cooperate to a greater extent than previously recognized to achieve tight spatial and temporal regulation of mTORC1 signaling.},

Under various physiological and pathological conditions, AMPK can be phosphorylated by an upstream kinase and bind to AMP or ADP rather than ATP, leading to its activation. Activated AMPK regulates a variety of metabolic processes, including autophagy. AMPK promotes autophagy directly by phosphorylating autophagy-related proteins in the mTORC1, ULK1, and PIK3C3/VPS34 complexes or indirectly by regulating the expression of autophagy-related genes downstream of transcription factors such as FOXO3, TFEB, and BRD4. AMPK can also upregulate the autophagic degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy), as it can induce fragmentation of damaged mitochondria in the network and promote the translocation of the autophagy machinery to damaged mitochondria. In this section, we will detail the molecular structure of AMPK, how its activity is regulated, and its pivotal role in regulating autophagy and mitophagy.},

  abstract  = {SAMTOR joins the family The amino acid methionine is widely appreciated to have interesting effects on animal physiology. Diets low in methionine increase longevity and overall health, particularly glucose homeostasis. Gu et al. describe a potential molecular link between the effects of methionine restriction and the growth controller mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), a well-validated regulator of life span and health span in many organisms. They identify a protein that they named SAMTOR as a component of the nutrient-sensing pathway upstream of mTORC1. SAMTOR directly binds S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a metabolite made from methionine, and is necessary for regulating mTORC1 in response to methionine. Science, this issue p. 813 mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates cell growth and metabolism in response to multiple environmental cues. Nutrients signal via the Rag guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) to promote the localization of mTORC1 to the lysosomal surface, its site of activation. We identified SAMTOR, a previously uncharacterized protein, which inhibits mTORC1 signaling by interacting with GATOR1, the GTPase activating protein (GAP) for RagA/B. We found that the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) disrupts the SAMTOR-GATOR1 complex by binding directly to SAMTOR with a dissociation constant of approximately 7 µM. In cells, methionine starvation reduces SAM levels below this dissociation constant and promotes the association of SAMTOR with GATOR1, thereby inhibiting mTORC1 signaling in a SAMTOR-dependent fashion. Methionine-induced activation of mTORC1 requires the SAM binding capacity of SAMTOR. Thus, SAMTOR is a SAM sensor that links methionine and one-carbon metabolism to mTORC1 signaling. SAMTOR is a SAM sensor that links methionine and one-carbon metabolism to mTORC1 signaling. SAMTOR is a SAM sensor that links methionine and one-carbon metabolism to mTORC1 signaling.},

  abstract   = {Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) at lysosomes plays a pivotal role in cell growth control where an array of large multiprotein complexes relay nutrient, energy, and growth signal inputs through mTORC1. In cancer cells, such regulation often becomes disconnected, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and an elevation in cellular stress. Consequently, cancer cells often lose homeostatic balance as they grow in unfavorable conditions, i.e. when nutrients and energy are limited yet mTORC1 is still aberrantly activated. Cancer cells lose signaling flexibility because of hyperactive mTORC1 that leads to heightened cellular stress and loss of nutrient and energy homeostasis, all of which are potential avenues for cancer therapy. Cancer cells often enhance mTORC1 to drive cell growth and proliferation, while also maintaining their survival. Autophagy regulation by mTORC1 is critically involved in nutrient and energy homeostasis, cell growth control, and survival. Studying mTORC1 and autophagy as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment has been the focus of a wide range of research over the past few decades. This review will explore the signaling pathways central to mTORC1 and autophagy regulation, and cancer vulnerabilities while considering anticancer therapies.},

Autophagy can have two functions in cancer. It can be tumour suppressive through the elimination of oncogenic protein substrates, toxic unfolded proteins and damaged organelles. Alternatively, it can be tumour promoting in established cancers through autophagy-mediated intracellular recycling that provides substrates for metabolism and that maintains the functional pool of mitochondria. Therefore, defining the context-specific role for autophagy in cancer and the mechanisms involved will be important to guide autophagy-based therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract  = {Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1) and polo like kinase 1 (PLK1) are major drivers of cancer cell growth and proliferation, and inhibitors of both protein kinases are currently being investigated in clinical studies. To date, MTORC1's and PLK1's functions are mostly studied separately, and reports on their mutual crosstalk are scarce. Here, we identify PLK1 as a physical MTORC1 interactor in human cancer cells. PLK1 inhibition enhances MTORC1 activity under nutrient sufficiency and in starved cells, and PLK1 directly phosphorylates the MTORC1 component RPTOR/RAPTOR in vitro. PLK1 and MTORC1 reside together at lysosomes, the subcellular site where MTORC1 is active. Consistent with an inhibitory role of PLK1 toward MTORC1, PLK1 overexpression inhibits lysosomal association of the PLK1-MTORC1 complex, whereas PLK1 inhibition promotes lysosomal localization of MTOR. PLK1-MTORC1 binding is enhanced by amino acid starvation, a condition known to increase autophagy. MTORC1 inhibition is an important step in autophagy activation. Consistently, PLK1 inhibition mitigates autophagy in cancer cells both under nutrient starvation and sufficiency, and a role of PLK1 in autophagy is also observed in the invertebrate model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. In summary, PLK1 inhibits MTORC1 and thereby positively contributes to autophagy. Since autophagy is increasingly recognized to contribute to tumor cell survival and growth, we propose that cautious monitoring of MTORC1 and autophagy readouts in clinical trials with PLK1 inhibitors is needed to develop strategies for optimized (combinatorial) cancer therapies targeting MTORC1, PLK1, and autophagy.},
